# hangman-node-app

For this app, we had to create a hangman game using node.js.  The new concept that was taught and used in the project was function constructors.  We were expected to use exports and spread our javascript code across multiple files so that we would gain experience accessing functions and variables from another file.

The new technologies used in the creation of this app was inquirer.js, is-letter.js, and the creation of exports from other created files.
    * the inquirer allows us to use the CLI as a prompt for the user.
    * the is-letter.js allows us to check to see if the user input is exactly a letter
    
This exercise proved to be very challenging!  I'm not 100% confident in using constructors or prototypes.  I will continue to recent these topics.
